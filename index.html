    <h1>Raw Nutrition — The Ancestral Path to Vitality</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Fares — a lifelong seeker of truth, health, and longevity. My journey into nutrition didn’t start with a textbook or a degree — it started with a question that haunted me: <strong>How do I live the longest, most vibrant life possible?</strong></p>

    <p>In a world overwhelmed by misinformation, processed foods, and artificial living, I began to strip everything back to the core — back to our biological roots. What I discovered changed everything: the optimal human diet is <strong>raw, natural, unprocessed</strong>.</p>

    <p>I immersed myself in the world of ancestral wisdom and healing through food. I devoured the works of raw food pioneers like <strong>Aajonus Vonderplanitz</strong>, who cured terminal illness not with medicine, but with raw meat and raw dairy. What sounded extreme became logical: our bodies are living organisms, and they thrive on living food.</p>

    <p>Since adopting this lifestyle, my energy has skyrocketed. I sleep deeply, recover faster, and experience an inner calm I never thought possible. This is not a diet — this is <em>life alignment</em>.</p>

    <p>My daily staples now include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🌱 Grass-fed <strong>raw beef</strong></li>
      <li>🥚 Bright-orange yolk <strong>raw eggs</strong></li>
      <li>🥛 Creamy, probiotic-rich <strong>raw milk</strong></li>
      <li>🧠 Nutrient-packed <strong>raw liver</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These foods are not dangerous — they’re powerful. Sourced properly, they’re safer than most fast food and infinitely more nourishing.</p>

    <p>Modern nutrition has led us astray. We're told to fear fat, avoid bacteria, and trust industrial food. But what if the key to lifelong health is exactly what we’ve been told to avoid?</p>

    <p>My mission is to bring awareness to the ancient principles of eating that empowered our ancestors. It’s about reconnecting with nature, with our physiology, and with the deep intelligence of the body.</p>

    <p>Ready to begin your own transformation? Start simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crack a <strong>raw egg</strong> into your smoothie</li>
      <li>Swap pasteurized milk for fresh <strong>raw dairy</strong></li>
      <li>Try a small piece of <strong>raw meat</strong> from a trusted local source</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your body will thank you. Your mind will clear. Your energy will return. This is the raw truth — and it’s time to live it.</p>

    <p><em>Eat raw. Live long. Thrive fully.</em></p>
